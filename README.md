I developed a script that automates folder creation and organizes files based on data provided in an Excel sheet.

The script reads an Excel sheet containing parent folder paths, destination folder paths, and file details.
It automatically generates folders in the specified destination.
File Organization:

It moves Excel files from the parent folder to the designated destination folder as specified in the Excel sheet.

Python (for scripting and automation)
Pandas (for handling Excel data)
OS and Shutil libraries (for file and folder operations)

This project has significantly streamlined file organization tasks, saving time and effort. It's a small step toward leveraging automation for everyday productivity challenges!
